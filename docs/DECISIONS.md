# Specter — decisions log

One line per non-obvious call and WHY, so it isn't re-litigated. Newest first.

- **2026-07-25 · Renamed module com.fleet.idrotate -> com.specter (namespace com.specter.module)** —
  the old applicationId leaked the internal codename in LSPosed's UI + notifications. applicationId is now
  `com.specter`; Java package `com.specter.module` (so generated R resolves); LSPosed entry
  `com.specter.module.HookEntry`. Removed the manifest `package=` attr (AGP takes namespace from gradle).
  ON-DEVICE this is a migration, not a rebrand: LSPosed registered it as a NEW module (mid 154), so scope
  had to be re-established (DevInfo + probe + fpjs). Old mid 25 stays until the new one is verified, then
  the old app is uninstalled. GeerGit (mid 101) never touched. scope_probe.py SPECTER_PKG updated to match.

- **2026-07-25 · Widevine coherence: return L3 (not a faked L1) alongside the spoofed deviceUniqueId** —
  probing PROVED the incoherence (spoofed id @ real L1 on the Pixel 4). Chose L3 because L3 = *software*
  Widevine, where a changing/derived device id is normal and expected; faking L1 while emitting a changing id
  would keep the contradiction (real L1 = fixed hardware id). Implemented as a Java getter hook on
  `getPropertyString("securityLevel")` — NO root, unlike byedentity's liboemcrypto bind-mount. Re-verified
  coherent on-device. The `media_drm_security_level` profile value is a CONSTANT ("L3") so it consumes no RNG
  → Java↔Python byte-parity is preserved automatically (no generator, no reorder).
- **2026-07-25 · byedentity adoption: probed the Widevine coherence hole FIRST, then fixed it (not blind)** —
  measured the mismatch on-device before committing the fix; HYPOTHESIS → PROVEN → fixed → proven-fixed, all
  on real hardware. The heavier root bind-mount (candidate #4) is unnecessary for this signal.
- **2026-07-25 · Do NOT adopt byedentity's server/anti-tamper stack** — its HMAC attestation, remote
  kill-switch (403→wipe local auth), public-IP telemetry, and native Frida gate serve byedentity's OWN
  licensing/control, not the user's anti-detection goal. Specter is deliberately stateless with no server
  leash. Adopt only the identity-coherence ideas (mask-preserving generators, DRM coherence, StatFs).
- **2026-07-25 · Port the mask-preserving-generator IDEA, not byedentity's native code** — its serial
  generators (buildMask/generateFromMask/generateLikePreservingBlocks) live in un-disassembled native
  (JNI names only = HYPOTHESIS on internals). Reimplement the concept (per-model format masks + prefixes)
  in generators.py with Java byte-parity + US-device templates; don't guess at their arithmetic.

- **2026-07-25 · Intermittent-detection finding is a HYPOTHESIS, not proven** — GeerGit HAS an
  IMEI-increment mode + manual-uniqueness burden (plausible cause of intermittent bans), but we have NOT
  confirmed it flags the fleet. Documented as hypothesis with a confirm-path; don't present as fact.
- **2026-07-25 · Deprioritize app-list spoofing** — it's a STABLE signal; can't cause the *intermittent*
  flagging the user reports. Completeness item, not the fleet fix.
- **2026-07-18 · Left CPU cores + SUPPORTED_ABIS real** — cores are physically fixed (faking breaks thread
  pools); ABI is near-constant arm64 and already coherent. Spoofing = risk with ~no entropy gain.
- **2026-07-18 · Did NOT hook /proc/cpuinfo** — hooking file-I/O constructors is the riskiest surface, the
  Xposed stub lacks hookAllConstructors, and ro.board.platform already spoofs the SoC name most tools read.
- **2026-07-18 · Profile-file hook-artifact left unfixed** — a targeted anti-Specter check could read
  `/data/local/tmp/specter/<pkg>.json`, but no real fingerprinting stack does; fix reintroduces file-I/O
  hook risk. Documented, deferred.
- **2026-07-18 · SoC/HARDWARE/BOARD/bootloader key on Build.PRODUCT (codename), not the device slot** —
  devices.json stores the marketing name ("Pixel 4") in the device slot for Google/LG; the real codename
  (flame) is in product. Keying on device silently produced incoherent SoCs. (Code-reviewer catch.)
- **2026-07-18 · USA-only** — removed UK/all other countries; US carriers (MCC 310-316), NANP phones,
  US-market brands (samsung/google/motorola/lge) only. Per user: everything US-focused.
- **2026-07-18 · Removed the 6 placeholder Settings toggles** — they were non-functional; never ship fake
  UI. Anti-fingerprinting is always-on (not a toggle); location deferred to a real later PR.
- **2026-07-18 · Narrow hooks / DevInfo-only scope justified by fragility + system-scope side effects**,
  NOT a "pairip kills broad hooks" law (that claim was disproved by device evidence — a broken base-only
  Dasher install, not a hook, caused the crash).
- **2026-07-25 · Spoof `ro.*` property aliases in the SAME hook, from the same profile values** — the
  dual-read probe proved `SystemProperties.get("ro.product.model")` returned the real `"Pixel 4"` while
  `Build.MODEL` was spoofed. Rather than a second hook, `hookSystemProperties` now builds a prop→value map
  (`PROP_ALIASES`) once per process and dispatches on lookup. Same one hot-path hook, no extra overhead,
  values identical to the fields (so coherent by construction) and no RNG draws (so byte-parity safe).
- **2026-07-25 · The native-read test MUST be in-process JNI, not `getprop`** — `getprop` execs a separate
  process that Specter never hooks, so it always shows real values regardless of whether our hooks work.
  It would "prove" a blind spot that might not exist. The probe calls libc `__system_property_get` inside
  the hooked process, which is what an NDK fingerprinting SDK actually does.
- **2026-07-25 · Native prop leak: documented, NOT yet fixed** — closing it needs a root layer that changes
  props at the source (`resetprop`), which mutates the whole device, not just the scoped app. That is a
  materially larger blast radius than a per-app Xposed hook and needs its own PR + coherence review.
  Logged as the top adoption candidate in `docs/IDEAS.md` instead of rushed in here.
- **2026-07-25 · The FPJS `factoryReset` leak is documented, NOT fixed in this PR** — proven that FPJS Pro
  re-identifies the device across three full identity rotations via a factory-reset timestamp read from
  directory mtimes (`/data/misc/profiles`, `/data/bootchart`, `/data/vendor`, `/data/dalvik-cache` — the
  first two readable without root). Two possible fixes, both needing their own review: (a) hook
  `java.io.File.lastModified()` for those paths only — our usual per-app mechanism, but `lastModified` is a
  very hot, very generic call and a too-broad match would break target apps; (b) root `touch` the dirs —
  device-wide, so it would also alter what GeerGit's fleet apps see, and it destroys the real value with no
  undo. Neither is a safe drive-by change, so the finding ships as evidence and the fix gets a dedicated PR.
- **2026-07-25 · `visitorFound:true` at `confidenceScore:1.0` is the metric that matters, not the visitorId
  string alone** — a rotating visitorId would be the pass signal; an unchanged one with `firstSeenAt` weeks
  in the past is proof of re-linking. Record the whole `identification` block (eventId to prove the call was
  fresh, firstSeenAt to prove the age of the link) when re-running this test, not just the id.
- **2026-07-25 · Hook BOTH `File.lastModified` and `Os.stat` for any filesystem-metadata signal** — the
  File-only hook was verified active on-device and the spoofed value verified returned, and FPJS Pro
  STILL read the real reset time, because it goes through `android.system.Os.stat().st_mtime`. One fact,
  two independent Java read paths; spoofing the obvious one is a cosmetic fix. The parity test now
  asserts both, so this can't regress. Generalises the same lesson as `Build.MODEL` vs `ro.product.model`.
- **2026-07-25 · `factory_reset_epoch` is derived from `build_security_patch`, not from a bare epoch** —
  coherence has to hold by construction, not by luck: an offset from the build's own patch date can
  never produce a device "reset before its OS existed". Cost is one extra generator argument; the
  alternative (random epoch + a validation retry loop) would burn RNG draws and complicate parity.
- **2026-07-25 · The new draw is appended LAST in the profile dict** — the seeded RNG is consumed in
  dict order, so inserting a draw anywhere else would change every subsequent field's value for the
  same seed and invalidate the no-reuse ledger. Appending is the only position that is parity-neutral
  for existing fields. Proven with a 200-seed Java-vs-Python dump diff, not assumed.
- **2026-07-25 · `factory_reset_epoch` reads NO wall clock — determinism beats a "never future" clamp**
  (code-review catch). The first cut clamped the value against `now()` sampled independently in Python
  and Java; a review proved that if the clamp ever fired, the two runtimes (different process, different
  instant) would diverge and break byte-parity — latent today (all pool patches are old enough) but a
  silent trap the moment the pool gains a recent phone. Fix: drop the clamp, make the value a pure
  function of (r, patch). "Never in the future" is now enforced by a TEST
  (test_factory_reset_is_after_the_build_and_in_the_past) that goes red — loudly — if a too-new patch
  enters the pool, instead of being silently patched over at runtime. A loud test failure is the right
  place for this invariant, not a clock read inside a parity-critical generator.
